# rock-paper-scissors
The goal of this project is to use Javascript (primarily) to develop a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This will be my first Javascript project, so I look forward to the learning experience that it will provide.

## implementing UI
After learning more about Javascript and how it can be used to interact with and manipulate the DOM, refactoring this project and including a UI is the next step. Users will be able select, on the web page, which option they'd like (rock, paper, or scissors). The computer's option will be automated, and a round winner will be determined based on the user selection and computer selection. A running score of user vs computer will be displayed on the screen at all times. Once a score of **5** is reached by either oponent, that oponent will be deemed the overall winner and the game will end.
